# **DRAFT** Not an official Purdue course (...yet)
# CS 390 - Emerging Technologies

This repository will maintain a list of CS 39000-EME approved courses on GitHub at [PurdueCS/courses](https://github.com/purduecs/courses). This repo will be initially set up and maintained by Prof. Dunsmore, Scott Opell and Alec Gorge.

Each course will layout the pass/fail grading criteria as well as the timetable for lectures, assignments and projects.

If a student cannot find a desired course in the CS 39000-EME listing, they can add a new course as described below.

The courses in the repository will be indexed by complexity and subject for easy identification of interesting subjects by students.

## Maintaining this organization

The workflow for adding a new course will be as follows.

If a student wants to propose a course, they should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and add their proposed content. They can copy and fill out the [template](./template_proposal.md). Once they want to submit it for approval, they can open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) in which content can be discussed and any issues can be worked out.

Once its approved, one of the the PurdueCS [organization](https://help.github.com/articles/about-organizations/) maintainers can merge the pull request to bring it into the main repository.

## Course creation based on a existing course

Good candidates for creating a new CS 39000-EME course are courses from other reputable schools that have all the lecture slides, assignments and book recommendations available online.

The easiest way to find some of these is to look at Prakhar Srivastav's ["Awesome Courses" repository](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses) on GitHub. It is a community maintained repository of "awesome university courses for learning Computer Science":

> There is a lot of hidden treasure lying within university pages scattered across the internet. This list is an attempt to bring to light those awesome courses which make their high-quality material i.e. assignments, lectures, notes, readings & examinations available online for free.

The sample course below is heavily based on a course found on Prakhar's repository.


## Multiple students taking the same course

Group work is encouraged! If students would like to, they can work in pairs on the homeworks and in groups of up to 4 on the final project (if applicable). This collaboration on the homeworks will give students more resources in a course that could get very challenging due to lack of a professor. Similarly, a piazza should be set up for each course/semester. These two things will help students stick to the timetable, get help as needed and promote discussion/further thought.
